# Regarding the Submission Process

The process for submission is done though our discord server. All attempts at submission through github will be ignored. All Submissions require evidence to be placed onto a blacklist.

# Notice to Law enforcement

If you are actively investigating this user, all evidence that is not withheld will be publically available for your file. Should evidence be withheld on our list, please contact OfficialDiscordBlacklist@gmail.com with the following
 - Department
 - Dept Phone number
 - Country
 - Badge Number
 - Evidence requested

You will be verified before we hand over anything.

# Requirements for a Verified Submission 

1. The user must not be already banned from discord itself (wont do anyone any good if their making a new acc)
2. There must be evidence that you share to us
 - File must compressed, Virus free and clearly labeled as username_evidence.extension
 - Allow for 24-48 hours of in processing.

On the surface this is simple but for those 24 hours we will be carefully combing the evidence to ensure the legitimacy.
