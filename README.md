## Welcome

This is a database that is updated daily to include usernames which have presented a credible threat to users on discord. Below you will learn the usecase for this database and how you might check a username against it quickly.

### What this is not:

This is not a list that usernames happen to find themselves on. The Blacklist will contain evidence of the users crimes and is not simply a 3 warns and your on it kind of deal. Its a: This person is a pdfile(Pedo), Abuser, Blackmailer, Ect ect... with evidence thrown in to back it. This might include Direct Message threads, photos, videos, soundfiles, and potentially traumatic triggers. 

### Abbreviations

Notable appreviations for the evidence include:

**TW** - Trigger Warning: If you are sensitive to certain kinds of abuse or have trauma surrounding it, its best you dont view this directly.

**BM** - Blackmail

**EXTR** - Extortion

**ABS** - Abuse

**PDFILE** - Pedophillia

**Underage** - For 18 plus servers underage.

**TOS** - Terms of Service Violations: usually means under 13 but can include harrassment.

## Special Thank You to Contributors

It's not always easy to add someone to a blacklist like this. It's important to remember that they did something to deserve this and it's entirely on their own head how this occured. They earned their spot on this list and removal from this list is nye impossible. Once you do these things the world will never see you the same way again, especially with considerable evidence backing the blacklist. For this reason, submissions to the blacklist are throughly investigated before the name is added and REQUIRE evidence. If evidence is found lacking we will add them to a WATCHLIST which will be included in this repo. A Watchlist CAN have a user removed easily due to lack of evidence. We thank our contributors for taking the time to put forth the effort to add to this list and keep discord a safe place.
